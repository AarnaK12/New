                  I know I said, that you are endangering yourselves to the pandemic by joining the protests.
                   But no one ever said you couldn't start your own protest. An eight year old boy recently made his own 
                   children's Black Lives Matter protest, so you can too. <br><br>
                   You can make a peaceful protest, or organize one with the help of others. The protests can get out of hand
                   so make them peaceful. Another thing to remember is that try to keep the protests socially distance instead of all walking 
                   together seperate into smaller groups and keep distance between the groups. This will help making sure that we aren't, 
                   risking ourselves to the coronavirus. <br><br>
                   The protests make the government take action because the people are at unrest. This is an extremely powerful ways
                   to support black lives matter. it also shows that, you won't give up until a change IS done.
